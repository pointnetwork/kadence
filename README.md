An implementation of the Kademlia DHT for Node.

## Usage

Install with NPM.

```bash
npm install kad
```

Create your node, plugin your storage adapter, and join the network.

```js
var kademlia = require('kad');
var levelup = require('levelup');

var dht = kademlia({
  address: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 65535,
  seeds: [
    { address: 'some.remote.host', port: 65535 }
  ],
  storage: levelup('path/to/db')
});
```

Then party.

```js
dht.on('connect', function() {

  dht.put('beep', 'boop', function(err) {
    dht.get('beep', function(err, value) {
      console.log(value); // 'boop'
    });
  });

});
```

## Persistence

Kad does not make assumptions about how your nodes will store their data,
instead relying on you to implement a storage adapter of your choice. This is
as simple as providing `get(key, callback)`, `put(key, value, callback)`,
`del(key, callback)`, and `createReadStream()` methods.

This works well with [levelup](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup), but you
could conceivably implement any storage layer you like provided you expose the
interface described above.

## NAT Traversal and Hole Punching

If your program runs on a user's personal computer, it's very likely that you
will need to forward a port on their router so peers can communicate when
behind a firewall. This is easy to do, using Indutny's
[node-nat-upnp](https://github.com/indutny/node-nat-upnp) module.

You'll want to do this *before* instantiating the Kademlia node.

```js
var nat = require('nat-upnp').createClient();
var port = 65535;

nat.portMapping({
  public: port,
  private: port,
  ttl: 0 // indefinite lease
}, function(err) {
  nat.externalIp(function(err, ip) {
    kad({ address: ip, port: port, /* ... */ }, function(err) {
      // ready to go!
    });
  });
});
```
